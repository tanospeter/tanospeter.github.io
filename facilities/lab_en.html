            The setup of a sample preparation laboratory for in-situ produced cosmogenic nuclides in our Institute begun in 2013. Since 2016, the laboratory has been prepared for processing quartz-containing sediment- and rock-samples for the Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) measurement of their in-situ cosmogenic <sup>10</sup>Be and <sup>26</sup>Al concentrations.
          </p>

            Terrestrial in situ produced cosmogenic nuclides – a geochronological tool for Quaternary geology and geomorphology
          </h3>
          <p>
            Terrestrial in-situ produced Cosmogenic Nuclides (TCN) are suitable for the determination of the exposure age, burial age and denudation rate of rock surfaces, sediments and landforms. The method is applicable in the time range of 10<sup>2</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> years and at variable lithologies. This time range covers the entire Quaternary and Pliocene hence it has occupied a significant role among the tools of Quaternary geochronology.                        
          </p>
          <p>
            Most important radioactive TCN in geological and geomorphological research are <sup>10</sup>Be (t<sub>1/2</sub>: 1.387 Ma), <sup>26</sup>Al (t<sub>1/2</sub>: 708 ka), <sup>36</sup>Cl (t<sub>1/2</sub>: 301 ka) and <sup>14</sup>C (t<sub>1/2</sub>: 5730 a). Two stable noble gas nuclides are also important, the <sup>3</sup>He and the <sup>21</sup>Ne. Radioactive nuclides reach their secular equilibrium after 3-4 half-lives, which defines the applicability range of the method.
          </p>
          <p>
            See more about the method in: Gosse and Phillips (2001); Dunai (2010); Granger et al. (2013) and references therein.
          </p>
          <h4>Exposure age determination</h4>
          <p>
            Exposure age of a rock is the time elapsed since it has been exposed to cosmic irradiation. The measured TCN concentration is representative of the exposure age of the studied landform (1) if the formation of the landform was instantaneous and (2) if no surface denudation or (3) sediment accumulation has occurred since its formation. Glacial landforms, fluvial terraces and lava flows are among the most frequent targets of exposure age determination.
          </p>
          <h4>Determination of denudation rates</h4>
          <p>
            In case of steady erosion TCN concentration within the rock is approaching a secular equilibrium. The faster is the denudation the lower is the equilibrium level. Accordingly, on a surface of long term steady erosion TCN concentrations are suitable for the determination of the surface denudation rate. The method is suitable for the quantification of surface denudation rates (on uncovered or soil mantled surfaces) and for the determination of average erosion rates of entire drainage basins.
          </p>
          <h4>Burial age determination</h4>
          <p>
            In contrast with exposure age and denudation rate determinations, burial age dating is based on the radioactive decay of cosmogenic nuclides. Those rocks and sediments are suitable for burial dating which once were exposed to cosmic irradiation, but have been buried since then. The time of burial (shielding from cosmic rays) can be determined using cosmogenic nuclide-pairs with different half-lives. Typical example is the burial dating of sediment trapped in caves using the <sup>26</sup>Al/<sup>10</sup>Be nuclide-pair.

            The laboratory is ready to process quartz-containing samples for the AMS measurement of their in-situ cosmogenic <sup>10</sup>Be and <sup>26</sup>Al concentrations.
          </p>
          <p>
            <sup>10</sup>Be is the by far the most commonly measured cosmogenic nuclide. Main reasons for its popularity in geological applications: (1) the abundance of the target mineral, quartz, (2) low natural <sup>9</sup>Be concentrations, (3) standardized chemistry, (4) good AMS precision, (5) relatively simple production depth profile.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cosmogenic <sup>26</sup>Al is usually used in pair with <sup>10</sup>Be. These nuclides can be measured on the same aliquot after a standardized chemistry process, and their different half-lives, and relatively well studied <sup>26</sup>Al/<sup>10</sup>Be production ratio makes them well suited to solve a variety of complex exposure and burial histories and to determine surface denudation rates.
          </p>
          <h4>Sample preparation for the measurement of cosmogenic in-situ produced <sup>10</sup>Be and <sup>26</sup>Al concentrations of quartz-containing rock samples</h4>          
          <h5>Physical treatment of the samples</h5>
          <p>
            From July 2017 crushing of rock samples occurs with a new Fritsch jaw crusher (Pulverisette 1, Model 2, Premium Line). (Earlier crushing occurred by a Retsch BB200 jaw crusher at the Central research and Instrument Centre of the Eötvös University, Budapest).
          </p>
          <p>
            Sieving occurs using a Retsch AS200 Vibratory Sieve Shaker in the Laboratory for Sediment and Soil Analysis of the Research Centre for Astronomy and Earth Sciences, Geographical Institute.
          </p>         
          <p>
            After getting rid of the carbonate and organic matter content of the crushed and sieved samples, a shape separator is used to separate platy minerals, like mica, from minerals of more isotropic shape. Then density separation is applied using heavy liquid (LST fastfloat) to separate quartz from heavier and lighter minerals.
          </p>
          <h5>Chemical treatment of the samples</h5>          
          <p>
            Chemical sample processing follows the procedures described by Brown et al. (1991) és Merchel and Herpers (1999). The quartz separates are chemically etched in (HCl-H<sub>2</sub>SiF<sub>6</sub>) and pure quartz is dissolved in in the presence of <sup>9</sup>Be carrier and evaporated. After substitution of HF by hydrochloric acid (HCl). <sup>27</sup>Al carrier is added to the samples if necessary and ion exchange columns (Dowex 1x8 and 50Wx8) and pH selective precipitation are used to extract <sup>10</sup>Be and <sup>26</sup>Al. Hydroxides are ignited at 900°C to reach the purified BeO and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The oxides are mixed with Nb and Ag powders, and pressed into cathodes, which will be the targets of the AMS measurements.
          </p>
          <h4>Measurements</h4>
          <p><sup>27</sup>Al concentrations (in case of samples for <sup>26</sup>Al determination) are measured at external laboratories:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>at the Institute of Nuclear Research, Hertelendy Laboratory of Environmental Studies (Debrecen, Hungary) using an Agilent MP-AE S 4100 facility;</li>
            <li>at the CEREGE (Aix en Provence, France) by ICP-OES; ICAP 6500 from Thermofisher;</li>

          </ol>
          <p>
            AMS measurements of isotope ratios of BeO and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> samples are performed at ASTER, the French National Facility, CEREGE, (Aix en Provence, France; Arnold et al., 2010) or at VERA, the Vienna Environmental Research Accelerator, Faculty of Physics, University of Vienna, (Vienna, Austria; Steier et al., 2019) in the framework of scientific cooperation. The measurements at ASTER were supported by the INSU/CNRS, the French Ministry of Research and Higher Education, IRD and CEA. Measurements performed at VERA were supported by the Radiate Transnational Access.
