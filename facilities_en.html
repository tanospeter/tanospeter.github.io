            The laboratory was established in 1990. Until 2005 the stable isotope laboratory was equipped with a Finnigan MAT delta S isotope ratio mass spectrometer that has a collector system for <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C, <sup>18</sup>O/<sup>16</sup>O, <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>14</sup>N and <sup>34</sup>S/<sup>32</sup>S ratio determinations in CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> gases, and a collector system for D/H ratio determination in H<sub>2</sub> gas. Now the lab also contains to other mass spectrometers. In 2005 a Finnigan delta plus XP mass spectrometer equipped with a GASBENCH II unit was installed. Although water samples can be analysed using CO<sub>2</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>O equilibration, the mass spec is currently used only for carbonate samples. In 2014 a Thermo Finnigan delta V mass spec was purchased and a TC/EA and and elemental analyzer were attached in order to measure H-C-N-O isotopes in organic matter and hydrous minerals. H-O isotope compositions of water samples are measured using two laser spectroscopes (Los Gatos Instruments), one of them dedicated to fluid inclusion research...

            The major profile of the laboratory is the analysis of geological materials for their chemical and phase composition; however, significant experiences are possessed on the analysis of (industrial) ceramics, metals, glasses, and materials of the cultural heritage. Its special areas of analysis are the clay mineral identification and structure analyses, the archeometric analysis, as well as the integrated phase and chemical micro-analysis. The laboratory consists of three parts: an X-Ray analytical, a micro-analytical and an inorganic chemical unit. An X-Ray micro-diffractometer, two X-Ray diffractometers, a laboratory and a handheld X-Ray fluorescent spectrometer, an electron microprobe, an atomic absorption spectrophotometer and an automatic titrator are operated in the laboratory. Basic and special sample preparation tools are also available there.

            The XRF laboratory is equipeed with a Philips PW 1410 type wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometer controlled by Philips X31 version 2.13 software is used at the Institute for Geochemical Research...

            The setup of a sample preparation laboratory for in-situ produced cosmogenic nuclides in our Institute begun in 2013. From 2014 to 2016 the laboratory has been prepared for processing quartz-containing sediment and rock samples for the determination of their in-situ produced cosmogenic <sup>10</sup>Be and <sup>26</sup>Al concentrations. Main research topics: exposure age and denudation rate determination of fluvial terraces using 10Be depth profiles, burial age determination using the <sup>26</sup>Al/<sup>10</sup>Be nuclide-pair and 10Be exposure age determination of glacial landforms...
